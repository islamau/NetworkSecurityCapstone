In this capstone project, I conducted a comprehensive network security assessment, gaining hands-on experience with various reconnaissance and scanning techniques.
Key Learning and Activities:

  1. Reconnaissance Techniques: Studied passive and active reconnaissance methods to gather information on network infrastructure and potential vulnerabilities.
  2. Protocol Understanding: Acquired knowledge of common network protocols, their operation, attack vectors, and mitigation techniques.
  3. Nmap Usage: Utilized Nmap extensively for tasks including live host discovery, advanced port scanning, OS and service version detection, and executing Nmap scripts. Saved and analyzed scan results to identify network weaknesses.
  4. Tool Application: Applied Nmap, Telnet, and Hydra tools during the challenge to perform detailed security assessments and exploit vulnerabilities.

This project enhanced my understanding of network security, including the functionality of various protocols and the effectiveness of different scanning and exploitation tools.
